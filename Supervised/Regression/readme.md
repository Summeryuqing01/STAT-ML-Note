## Common Algorithms:
* [Linear Regression](/Linear&Regression.ipynb)
* Multiple Linear Regression
* [Polynomial Regression](/Polynomial&Regression.ipynb)
* [L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) Regression](/Lasso&and&Ridge&Regression.ipynb)
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* ElasticNet Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable.
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the mean squared error.
* Huber Loss: A hybrid loss function that transitions from MAE to MSE for larger errors, providing balance between robustness and MSE’s sensitivity to outliers.
* R2 – Score: Higher values indicate better fit ranging from 0 to 1.
