## Common Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* [K-nearest Neighbors](/K-Nearest&Neighbors&KNN.ipynb)
* [Decision Tree](/Decision&tree.ipynb)
* [Random Forest](/Random&Forest.ipynb)
* [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](/Support&Vector&Machine.ipynb)
* Naive Bayes

## Evaluation Metrics
* Accuracy: proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions
* Precision: how many of the positive predictions made by the model are actually correct
* Recall: how many of the actual positive cases were correctly identified by the model
* F-1 Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall
* Log Loss: the uncertainty of the model’s predictions
* AUC and ROC: The AUC value represents the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative example
* ROC Curve: True Positive Rate (TPR) vs the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds<br>
  sensitivity (TPR) and specificity (1 - FPR) tradeoff
* Confusion Matrix
